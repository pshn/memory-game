# Memory Game Project

## How to Play
Select a card to match the card icon with that of another. If the icons are the same, then the cards are matched. If the icons are different, then the cards are not a match and flipped over.

## Notes
This is a timed game, so try to match all the cards in less time! Stars are rated by the number of matches, so fewer guesses means more stars.
